                  to create event scripts while I was modding on my favourite video games.
                  That is the reason why I have chosen to turn to computer sciences and, at
                  some point, specializing into web oriented development.`,

                  my focus towards CSS preprocessors as well as JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
                  Now my main technologies.`,
    'aboutText3': `I try to keep updated about the latest UX reports and methodologies too.
                  The Nielsen & Norman Group is my main reference by the way.
                  My favorite field is definitely Interaction Design (IxD).
                  Because it makes sense, as a developer, to test the viability of the interactions first,
                  through prototypes, before implementing them on prod.`,
    'aboutText4': `Proposing cutting edge front-end solutions in line with the design specifications;
                  structuring the components and their templates; organising the stylesheets based on standard methodologies
                  (OOCSS is my favorite). All that makes my everyday journey.`,
