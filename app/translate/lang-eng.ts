    'aboutText0': `The first techs I learned were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and PHP. I slightly decided 
                  to focus more on frontend technologies and to lean towards sophisticated JS frameworks as well as CSS
                  pre-processors like Sass.`,
    'aboutText1': `I try to keep updated about the latest UX reports and practices.
                  The ones advocated by the Nielsen & Norman Group are my main reference.
                  My favorite fields are definitely Interaction and Interface Design.
                  I use these skills to build user-centred and consistent interfaces.`,
    'aboutText2': `It dates back from when I was support technician at the University Hospital of Montpellier.
                  The change from a previous Hospital Information System software to a new one
                  had seriously damaged the productivity of the different medical staffs.
                  Mainly because of the messy and inconsistent new interface. That is why I give so much
                  importance to the detail as well as the user experience since.`,
