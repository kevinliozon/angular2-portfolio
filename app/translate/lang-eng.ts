                  date back when I was field support technician contractor at the
                  University Hospital of Montpellier, during the deployment
                  of their new Hospital Information System software.
                  The brutal change from a previous interface to a new one
                  has driven a lot of issues and seriously damaged the productivity
                  of the different medical staffs; forced to spend time at
                  adapting to a new software as a result. That is why I give so much
                  importance to the detail and the user exeprience.`,
    'aboutText1': `Since my very first techs were HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I evolved
                  towards CSS preprocessors as well as JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
                  Even if I had some experiences using backend techs (PHP, SQL); I decided
                  at some point to focus exclusively on frontend technologies. Using my
                  designer skills to build user-friendly and consistent interfaces.`,
    'aboutText2': `I try to keep updated about the latest UX reports and methodologies too.
                  The Nielsen & Norman Group is my main reference by the way.
                  My favorite field is definitely Interaction Design (IxD).
                  Because it makes sense, as a developer, to test the viability of
                  the interactions first, through prototypes, before implementing anything.`
